## Personalization Tips

### Available Variables (from sample Excel):
- `{phone}` - Phone number
- `{name}` - Full name  
- `{first_name}` - First name only
- `{last_name}` - Last name only
- `{company}` - Company name
- `{city}` - City/Location
- `{last_purchase}` - Previous purchase
- `{purchase_amount}` - Amount spent

### Best Practices:
1. **Keep it personal** - Use first_name for warmth
2. **Be relevant** - Reference their city, company, or past purchases
3. **Clear call-to-action** - What do you want them to do?
4. **Professional tone** - Maintain brand voice
5. **Test first** - Send to yourself before bulk sending
6. **Respect length** - WhatsApp works best with shorter messages
7. **Include emojis** - But use sparingly for professional communication

### Template Testing:
Before sending to all contacts, test your template with a few entries to ensure:
- All placeholders are replaced correctly
- Message flows naturally
- No spelling/grammar errors
- Call-to-action is clear
