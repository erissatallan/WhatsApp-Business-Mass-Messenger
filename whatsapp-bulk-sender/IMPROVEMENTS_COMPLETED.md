# UI and AI Improvements Completed

## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Fixed Opt-out Display Bug
**Issue:** The opt-out indicator was showing "üö´ Opt-out0" for all replies
**Solution:** Fixed the condition check from `{reply.is_opt_out && ...}` to `{(reply.is_opt_out === true || reply.is_opt_out === 1) && ...}`
**File:** `frontend/src/RepliesTab.js`

### 2. Added Search Functionality
**Feature:** Full-text search across all reply data
**Implementation:**
- Added `searchQuery` state variable
- Added `filteredReplies` computed state with useEffect filtering
- Search filters by: sender name, phone number, message content, campaign name
- Real-time filtering as user types
- Added search input field in the filters section
- Updated Clear Filters to reset search query

**File:** `frontend/src/RepliesTab.js`

### 3. Added Scroll Bars to Replies Container
**Feature:** Better UX for viewing large number of replies
**Implementation:**
- Changed replies container to use `max-h-96 overflow-y-auto`
- Replies list now scrolls vertically when content exceeds viewport
- Updated to use `filteredReplies` instead of `replies` for search functionality

**File:** `frontend/src/RepliesTab.js`

### 4. Enhanced Gemini AI Question Detection
**Issue:** AI wasn't detecting questions without question marks in multiple languages
**Solution:** Enhanced the Gemini prompt with better language patterns:
- Added explicit patterns for Dholuo: "Anyalo yudo..." (Can I get...), "Ango..." (How much...)
- Added explicit patterns for Gikuyu: "Nƒ©ngƒ©heo..." (Can I get...), "Nƒ© ngathe..." (How much...)
- Added implicit question detection: "I need to know", "Tell me about", "Looking for"
- Enhanced cultural communication pattern recognition
- Better detection of information-seeking intent without question marks

**File:** `backend/reply_handler.py` - `detect_reply_sentiment_gemini` function

### 5. Implemented Gemini-Powered Intelligent Auto-Responses
**Feature:** AI-generated contextual responses instead of template responses
**Implementation:**
- Added `generate_intelligent_response_gemini` function
- Generates personalized responses based on customer message content and sentiment
- Maintains professional, culturally appropriate tone
- Matches customer's language (English, Swahili, Dholuo, Gikuyu)
- Includes business information (products, pricing, delivery)
- Automatic compliance footer injection
- Graceful fallback to template responses if AI fails

**Files:** 
- `backend/reply_handler.py` - New `generate_intelligent_response_gemini` function
- `backend/reply_handler.py` - Updated `generate_auto_response` function
